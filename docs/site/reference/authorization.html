    Authorization is the process of giving someone permission to do or see something.
    It is used to determine what the authenticated user is allowed to do in the application
    and what data he is allowed to see.
  </p>
  
<div class="section">
<h2>     Organizing Authorization<a name="Organizing_Authorization"></a></h2>
    
<p>
	  There are different ways of organizing authorization.
      Widely used approaches are role-based authorization or access control lists.
    </p>
    
<ul>
      
<li>
        
          In role-based Authorization users are assigned to roles. Rights to do or get something are granted to these roles.
        
      </li>
      
<li>
        
          In the concept of &quot;Access Control Lists&quot;
          an access control list is assigned to every object that has to be accessed.
          An access control list is a list of access control entries. Every of
          this entries holds a reference to a user or a role it is valid for,
          as well as the access rights that the referenced user or role has on
          the object.
                  
      </li>
    </ul>
    <!-- example>
      <title>Example:</title>
      Let there be the following business requirements:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>Administrators may get (i.e. view) TestBeans</listitem>
        <listitem>Administrators may delete TestBeans</listitem>
        <listitem>Users may own TestBeans</listitem>
        <listitem>Users may get (i.e. view) their owned TestBeans</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      In this scenario we have two roles: administrator and user.
      With JavaEE you may solve this at the session-bean level by some session bean like this:
      <programlisting>
        @Stateless
        public class TestBeanDao {
         	
          	@PersistenceContext
            	private EntityManager entityManager;
              	
               	@RolesAllowed("administrator");
               	public List&lt;TestBean&gt; getAllTestBeans() {
               		return entityManager.createQuery("SELECT t FROM TestBean t")
               		                    .getResultList();
               	}
               	
               	@RolesAllowed("administrator");
               	public void deleteTestBean(TestBean testBean) {
               		entityManager.remove(testBean);
               	}
                	
               	@RolesAllowed("user");
               	public List&lt;TestBean&gt; getTestBeansForUser(User user) {
               		return entityManager.createQuery("SELECT t FROM TestBean t WHERE t.owner = :user")
               		                    .setParameter("user", user)
               		                    .getResultList();
               	}
              }
      </programlisting>

<h2>     Access Control: Authorization in Action<a name="Access_Control:_Authorization_in_Action"></a></h2>
    
<p>
      Access Control is the process of allowing and forbidding access to resources
      based on the authorization of the current security context. There are different
      levels of access control.
    </p>
    
<ul>
      
<li>
        
          Presentation left access control - Access control is implemented
          in the presentation tier of the application. Only data that the
          user is allowed to see is displayed and only buttons for actions
          that the user is allowed to do are displayed and enabled. Although
          it may be necessary to provide different views to users with
          different roles, handling access control only at the presentation
          layer can be a big problem, when it involves loading and 
          transferring masses of data to the presentation layer,
          where it gets filtered out, because the current user is not allowed
          to see it.
        
      </li>
      
<li>
        
          Service level access control - Access control is implemented in
          the service tier. Often this is realized using method-based
          access control. For every method in the service tier it is defined
          which users and/or roles are allowed to call it. Although this kind
          of security is widely supported by current security solutions like
          JavaEE Security and Spring Security it is often not the correct location
          of handling access control because access control usually depends
          more on the data used than on the actions executed. This leads to
          code that checks the current user and/or its roles to decide which
          data access tier method to invoke or this kind of checks are done
          by the code invoking the service methods. However manual handling
          of authorization informations leads to spreading the security all
          over the code. This makes changes to security requirements hard to handle.
        
      </li>
      
<li>
        
          Class level access control - Using class level access control on
          the entity beans of an application leads to a more fine-graded
          access control mechanism. If you are able to define which
          entity types may be used by which user or role (and you can do this
          in EJB 3 with the <i><tt>@RolesAllowed</tt></i> annotation) you have a clean way
          of defining which user may see and/or change which data without
          manual handling of authorization information. However this level
          is not detailed enough in many cases.
        
      </li>
      
<li>
        
          Instance level access control - With instance level access control
          for every user and/or role you can define permissions on an entity
          basis. Access Control Lists
          are widely used for this approach, but JPA Security provides a more
          flexible way to accomplish this, like we see later.
        
      </li>
      
<li>
        
          Property level access control - A step further from instance level
          access control is property level access control, where you can define
          access restrictions on a property base. JPA Security currently only supports
          property level access control for properties of type <i><tt>@Embeddable</tt></i>
          by providing instance level access control for embeddables.
        
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
<div class="section">
<h2>     Access Control in JPA Security<a name="Access_Control_in_JPA_Security"></a></h2>
    
<p>
      In JPA Security the access to entities and embeddables is defined by access rules.
      There is one set of access rules per security unit. This set of access rules
      applies to every JPA query and every entity and embeddable you get out of an
      <i><tt>EntityManager</tt></i> of the persistence unit that corresponds
      to that security unit.
    </p>
    
<div class="section">
<h3>       Example: Access Rule<a name="Example:_Access_Rule"></a></h3>
      
<p>
        The following rule restricts the read access to accounts,
        where the owner is equal to the current user. In other words:
        every user can read only its own accounts.
      </p>
      
<div class="source">
<pre>
        GRANT READ ACCESS TO Account account WHERE account.owner = CURRENT_PRINCIPAL
      </pre></div>
      
<p>
        In the previous example the <tt>CURRENT_PRINCIPAL</tt> is provided
        by the currently active security context. When the access rule is evaluated, the
        <tt>CURRENT_PRINCIPAL</tt> is received from the security context
        and the rule is evaluated against this principal
      </p>
    </div>
    
<div class="section">
<h3>       Access Rules in JPA Security<a name="Access_Rules_in_JPA_Security"></a></h3>
      
<p>
        JPA Security allows the definition of rules that grant create, read, update and/or delete access.
        Currently there is no explicit way to deny access. Although this is not needed,
        since every entity or embeddable to which no access is granted may not be accessed.
        An exception from this behavior are classes for which no access rule exists at all.
        Objects of such class may be accessed without any restriction.
      </p>
    </div>
    
<div class="section">
<h3>       The syntax of access rules<a name="The_syntax_of_access_rules"></a></h3>
      
<p>
        The general syntax of an access rule of JPA Security looks like <b>GRANT [CREATE] [READ] [UPDATE] [DELETE] ACCESS TO </b>
        <i><tt>entity_name alias</tt></i> <b>[</b><i><tt>where_clause</tt></i><b>]</b>,
	    where <i><tt>entity_name</tt></i> must be an entity or embeddable of the persistence unit (according to the JPA Specification,
        defaults to the class name if not otherwise specified) and the <i><tt>alias</tt></i> is an alias for that entity or embeddable
        that may be used in the where clause.
      </p>
      
<p>
	    The syntax of the <i><tt>where_clause</tt></i> is derived from the syntax of <b>WHERE</b> clauses of JPQL, the query
        language of JPA. Within the clause any alias may be used that is defined by your current security context. The build-in security contexts
        define two aliases, which are <b>CURRENT_PRINCIPAL</b> and <b>CURRENT_ROLES</b>.
        The <b>CURRENT_PRINCIPAL</b> alias will be evaluated to the currently authenticated
        principal during runtime and the <b>CURRENT_ROLES</b> alias will be expanded to a list
        of roles that the current principal belongs to. No input parameters may be used in the <b>WHERE</b> clause of access rules.
        If you need more aliases to be defined (i.e. <b>CURRENT_TENANT</b>),
        you will have to implement your own security context like described later.
      </p>
    </div>
    
<div class="section">
<h3>       Providing access rules<a name="Providing_access_rules"></a></h3>
      
<p>
        With JPA Security there are two predefined ways to provide access rules:
        via XML configuration or via Annotations. In a later chapter we will see 
        how to implement your own way of providing access rules.
      </p>
      
        
<div class="section">
<h4>Access rules via XML<a name="Access_rules_via_XML"></a></h4>
        
<p>
          One predefined way to provide access rules in JPA Security is via a file
          called <tt>security.xml</tt>, which is located in the <tt>META-INF</tt>
          directory of your application. Below is an example of the structure of such file:
        </p>
        
<div class="source">
<pre>
&lt;security xmlns=&quot;http://jpasecurity.sf.net/xml/ns/security&quot;
          xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;
          xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://jpasecurity.sf.net/xml/ns/security
                              http://jpasecurity.sf.net/xml/ns/security/security_1_0.xsd&quot;
          version=&quot;1.0&quot;&gt;

  &lt;persistence-unit name=&quot;...&quot;&gt;
    &lt;access-rule&gt;...&lt;/access-rule&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/persistence-unit&gt;
&lt;/security&gt;
        </pre></div>
      
      
        </div>
<div class="section">
<h4>Access rules via Annotations<a name="Access_rules_via_Annotations"></a></h4>
        
<p>
          The other predefined way to provide access rules in JPA Security is via Annotations.
          You may annotate your entity classes with one of the following two annotations:
          <i><tt>javax.annotation.security.RolesAllowed</tt></i> and
          <i><tt>org.jpasecurity.security.rules.Permit</tt></i>.
        </p>
        
<p>
          Note that the semantics of the <i><tt>@RolesAllowed</tt></i> annotation slightly differs
          between the EJB Specification and JPA Security: If you annotate a class with the
          <i><tt>@RolesAllowed</tt></i> annotation this means for EJB any access to any method
          of an instance of that class will cause a <i><tt>SecurityException</tt></i>, if the
          current user is not in one of the roles allowed. JPA Security goes a step further:
          The current user will not retrieve this object from database if he is not in one of
          the roles allowed. JPA Security does not support the <i><tt>@RolesAllowed</tt></i>
          annotation at method-level.
        </p>
        
<p>
          The <i><tt>@Permit</tt></i> annotation has two optional parameters:
        </p>
        
<ul>
          
<li>
            
              With the parameter <i><tt>access</tt></i> you can specify
              which kind of access shall be granted by this rule.
              The value is an array of the <i><tt>AccessType</tt></i> enum. 
              Possible values of an <i><tt>AccessType</tt></i> are
              <i><tt>CREATE</tt></i>, <i><tt>READ</tt></i>,
              <i><tt>UPDATe</tt></i> and <i><tt>DELETE</tt></i>.
            
          </li>
          
<li>
            
              With the parameter <i><tt>rule</tt></i> you can specify a
              rule to restict the access for entities of the annotated class.
              The syntax of this rule is derived from the
              <i><tt>where</tt></i>-clause of JPQL (see previous section),
              where the special keyword <i><tt>this</tt></i> serves as an
              alias for the annotated entity or embeddable that may be used in the rule.
            
          </li>
        </ul>
        
<p>
          Example:
        </p>
        
<div class="source">
<pre>
@Permit(access = AccessType.READ, rule = &quot;owner = CURRENT_PRINCIPAL&quot;)
public class Account {
    ...
}

<h4>Applying of access rules<a name="Applying_of_access_rules"></a></h4>
        
<p>
          Read-access rules are applied to every entity or embeddable that is accessed via a
          JPA-Security-enabled <i><tt>EntityManager</tt></i> or via object-navigation
          through objects obtained from such <i><tt>EntityManager</tt></i>. 
          When the object is accessed via JPQL, the access rules are applied
          directly to the JPQL-query, allowing the filtering to take place within the database.
          When the object is accessed via object-navigation, JPA Security tries to avoid database-calls
          and evaluates the rules in memory. When in-memory-evaluation is not applicable and the
          entity-manager is still open, a query is performed to evaluate the query.
          In the next section you can read, in which cases in-memory-evaluation is applicable and
          where not. 
          When in-memory-evaluation is not applicable and the entity-manager is already closed,
          a <i><tt>SecurityException</tt></i> will be thrown.
        </p>
        
<p>
		  Update-access rules are applied on <i><tt>flush()</tt></i> or <i><tt>commit()</tt></i>.
		  Again the default-behaviour is in-memory-evaluation then, falling back to a query like described above.
        </p>
        
<p>
          Create-access rules and delete-access rules are applied when the appropriate action is performed
          with the entity-manager (either direct or by cascading). In-memory-evaluation applies like described above.
        </p>
        
<p>
          For all cases JPA Security is clever enough to apply the appropriate access rules for sub-
          and superclasses, too.
        </p>
      
      
        </div>
<div class="section">
<h4>In-Memory-Evaluation<a name="In-Memory-Evaluation"></a></h4>
        
<p>
          Every access rule that does not contain any sub-select can be evaluated in memory.
          For queries that contain sub-selects it depends on the kind of the sub-select
          and the content of the (first-level) entity-manager-cache of JPA Security.
          Sub-selects where all aliases from within the sub-select can directly replaced with
          an alias from outside can be evaluated in memory. Thus the following access rule
          can be evaluated in memory: 
        </p>
        
<div class="source">
<pre>
          
GRAND ACCESS TO TestBean bean WHERE EXISTS (SELECT b FROM TestBean b WHERE b = bean AND b.accessControlList = CURRENT_PRINCIPAL)
          
        </pre></div>
<!-- TODO: Test this restriction, it is likely to be gone
        <para>
          Sub-selects that contain collection-joins cannot directly evaluated in memory and the
          result of the evaluation depends on the content of the (first-level) entity-manager-cache.
          Thus the following query cannot be evaluated in memory:
        </para>
        <programlisting>
          <![CDATA[
GRAND ACCESS TO TestBean bean WHERE EXISTS (SELECT b FROM TestBean b, IN(b.accessControlList.entries) entry WHERE b = bean AND entry IN (CURRENT_ROLES)
          ]]>
        </programlisting> -->
        
<p>
          Since the alias from within the sub-select cannot directly replaced by the alias from outside,
          the following query cannot be evaluated in memory:
        </p>
        
<div class="source">
<pre>
          
GRAND ACCESS TO TestBean bean WHERE EXISTS (SELECT entry FROM AccessControlListEntry entry WHERE bean.accessControlList = entry.accessControlList AND entry IN (CURRENT_ROLES)
          
        </pre></div>
        
<p>
		  Although there can be no guarantee in general that the last query can be evaluated in memory,
		  in-memory-evaluation can still be achieved by ensuring that the entities that are needed to evaluate
		  the sub-select are contained in the (first-level) entity-manager-cache. For example the last rule
		  can be evaluated in memory if there exists an <i><tt>AccessContolListEntry</tt></i> in the
		  cache that meets the specified where-clause. Remember, that on persist the check will be done
		  before the persist-operation is cascaded. So when you want to persist a <i><tt>TestBean</tt></i>
		  that contains an <i><tt>accessControlList</tt></i> with entries that match the where-clause,
		  you have to persist the entries before you persist the <i><tt>TestBean</tt></i> to ensure
		  the entries are in the cache. 
        </p>
