  <title>Basic Setup</title>
  <para>
    We want to use Maven 2 to build and run our application.
    Maven will try to download the needed dependencies from a remote repository.
    So please ensure you are connected to the internet.
    We set up our project with the following command:
  </para>
  <programlisting>
    <![CDATA[
mvn archetype:create -DgroupId=org.jpasecurity -DartifactId=jpasecurity-simple-sample -Dversion=0.4.1-SNAPSHOT
    ]]>
  </programlisting>
  <para>
    This created a directory called jpasecurity-simple-sample with a file named pom.xml
    and a subdirectory named src in it. Within the src-directory there is a directory-structure
    special to Maven. We will place our classes in src/main/java. Maven already created the
    packages org.jpasecurity for us. Within this package Maven created a simple
    Hello-World-example called App.java.
    Maven also created src/test/java, but we don't need this directory nor its subdirectories,
    so we can savely delete it.
    We now create subfolders in our src/main/java/net/sf/jpasecurity folder named sample/simple
    and move the App.java into it. Don't forget to correct the package declaration in the App.java
    to point to the right package:
  </para>
  <programlisting>
package org.jpasecurity.sample.simple;
  </programlisting>
  <para>
    Our sample shall be compiled and executed with Java 5 and shall be packed into an executable jar file.
    In order to configure Maven to do so, we have to add the following configuration to the pom.xml
    before the &lt;dependencies&gt; section:

  <para>
    You can now compile our project by issuing the following Maven command
    from within the jpasecurity-simple-sample folder:
  </para>
  <programlisting>
mvn package
  </programlisting>
  <para>
    If everything is configured correctly this command should end with
    something like "BUILD SUCCESSFUL" and you can start our application
    by changing into the subdirectory <filename>target</filename> and issueing
    the following command:
  </para>
  <programlisting>
    <![CDATA[
java -jar jpasecurity-simple-sample-0.4.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
    ]]>
  </programlisting>
  <para>
    If you now see the output "Hello World!" you have successfully set up this sample.
