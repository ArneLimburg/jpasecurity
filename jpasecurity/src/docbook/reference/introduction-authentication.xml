  <para>
    Authentication is the process of determining and verifying
    the identity of someone or something. In multi-user applications,
    the process of authentication for an application is needed to get
    knowledge about the person that is currently using the application.
    The widely used process for authentication is a login process during
    which the user is asked for his username and password.
    A user that knows one of this username/password-tuples is assumend
    to be the person belonging to that username. Besides
    username/password authentication there are other methods like
    public-key-authentication with a digital certificate, to name just one.
