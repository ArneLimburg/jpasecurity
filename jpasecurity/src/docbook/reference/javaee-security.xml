  <title>Integration with JavaEE Security</title>
  <para>
    To use JavaEE Authentication for JPA Security you may integrate JPA Security like
    described in the previous chapter and specify
    <programlisting>net.sf.jpasecurity.security.authentication.EjbAuthenticationProvider</programlisting>
    as authentication provider in your persistence properties.
    You need to define all the roles your application is using
    with the <programlisting>@DeclareRoles</programlisting> annotation at at least one of your entity beans
    in order to make the <programlisting>EjbAuthenticationProvider</programlisting> to work correctly.
