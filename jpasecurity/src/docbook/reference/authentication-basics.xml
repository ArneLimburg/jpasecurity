  <title>Authentication Basics</title>
  <para>
    JPA Security uses an implementation of the <code>net.sf.jpasecurity.authentication.AuthenticationProvider</code>
    interface to be aware of the currently authenticated user and/or it's roles at runtime. The chapter about
    integrating JPA Security will show how to configure this and the chapter about authentication will show which
    authentication provider to use.
