  <title>The syntax of access rules</title>
  <para>
    An access rule of JPA Security always starts with <code>GRANT READ ACCESS TO</code>,
    followed by the entity name (according to the JPA Specification,
    defaults to the class name if not otherwise specified)
    and an alias for that entity.
  </para>
  <para>
    The GRANT clause is optionally followed by a WHERE clause,
    thats syntax is derived from the syntax of WHERE clauses of JPQL, the query
    language of JPA. Within the WHERE clause there are two special input parameters
    that may be used, which are <code>:user</code> and <code>:roles</code>.
    The <code>:user</code> parameters will be evaluated to the currently authenticated
    user during runtime and the <code>:roles</code> parameter will be expanded to a list
    of roles that the current user belongs to. No other input parameters may be used in
    the WHERE clause of access rules.
