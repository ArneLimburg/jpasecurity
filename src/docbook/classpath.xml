  <title>JPA Security in your classpath</title>
  <para>
    First you have to make sure that JPA Security appears
    in your classpath. We do not provide a detailed description
    how to do this here, since this depends heavlily on your local
    environment and settings.

  <para>
    If you want to use JPA Security within an JavaEE application server,
    it may treat JPA Security like a persistence provider.
    please refer to the manual of your application server on how to
    integrate a new persistence provider and integrate JPA Security like
    it is described there.
