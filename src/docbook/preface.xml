    Developing enterprise software applications with security requirements 
    can be a cumbersome and error-prone process. In such applications often
    the security is spread all over the application code. This makes it difficult
    to understand how things work and hard to maintain security in such code.

    JPA Security provides an interface to define security requirements of your
    Data Access Layer at a single place in code for ease of usability and
    maintainability.
    It is designed to extend current security solutions like JavaEE Security and
    Spring Security (formerly known as Acegi-Security),
    but may be used on its own, too. It enables applications to control access
    to JPA Entity Beans based on the currently authenticated user
    and/or its roles in the application.
